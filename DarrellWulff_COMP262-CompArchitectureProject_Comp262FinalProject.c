/******************************************************************************
* COMP 262 Final Project: Casino Royale: Parallelized Blackjack Edition
* Authors: Taseen Hafiz, Darrell Wulff
* Date: 11/15/19
* To run: gcc -fopenmp -o final.out Comp262FinalProject.c -lm blackJackBehavior.c
* For Lab Macs: clang -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -lomp -o final.out Comp262FinalProject.c blackJackBehavior.c
* NOTE: Throughout the program, "omp_get_thread_num()" is going to be used to determine which client/dealer the action applies to.
*
*Summary of the implementation:

    This implementation of BlackJack uses the power of OpenMP's 
    parallel for loops and thread numbering. After intitalizing
    the variables needed for a game of blackjack we enter into
    the main game loop. This while loop will continue as long
    as the user keeps the game state set to true. Leveraging 
    the parallel for loop we staticly schedule 5 threads to
    be the participants of the game. Until the threads hit 
    the ordered section of the loop, it does not matter the
    order in which initial bets, hands, points, and other data
    is calculated. This allows for the game to take advantage
    of parallel calculations. Once the code reaches the ordered
    area the threads will run one after the other to decide to hit
    or stay. Thread 0 acts as the dealer and the others as clients,
    so there is some careful consideration as to when the dealer
    gets to act ever when its not the thread running. The clients
    also decide to hit and stay based on a scoring AI system. The
    AI scoring system is not in parallel but makes the game more
    interesting as their is more thought put into their actions. Then
    the winners are found in a parallel loop since the order again
    is not critical. A secondfile was created to abstract away some 
    functionality and read in data based on the thread number. 
    Overall this implementation is based around the simple idea of 
    threads being it's own entity in a game.
